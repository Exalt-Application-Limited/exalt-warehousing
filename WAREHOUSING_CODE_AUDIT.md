   - Event-driven architecture readiness
   - CQRS pattern in analytics service

4. **Security Considerations**
   - JWT token implementation
   - Role-based access control
   - API gateway security

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

1. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - Need to implement OpenFeign clients
   - Missing service contracts/APIs
   - No event bus implementation

2. **Data Consistency**
   - No distributed transaction handling
   - Missing saga pattern implementation
   - Need eventual consistency strategy

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis integration incomplete
   - No cache-aside pattern implementation
   - Missing cache invalidation logic

---

## 3. Code Quality Assessment

### Clean Code Principles

#### ‚úÖ Well Implemented
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has clear boundaries
- **DRY**: Shared library for common code
- **SOLID**: Good interface segregation

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention
- **Magic Numbers**: Some hardcoded values in business logic
- **Complex Methods**: Some service methods exceed 50 lines
- **Comment Quality**: Missing JavaDoc in many places

### Design Patterns Usage

#### ‚úÖ Implemented Patterns
